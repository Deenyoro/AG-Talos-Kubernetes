# Kubernetes Cluster Health Assessment
**Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Assessment Type:** Read-Only Comprehensive Health Check  
**Focus:** Post-incident analysis following PostgreSQL/Zammad outage  

## Executive Summary

The cluster shows **mixed health status** with several critical issues requiring immediate attention. While the Zammad service has been restored, the underlying PostgreSQL storage issues persist, and multiple infrastructure components are experiencing failures.

**Overall Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEGRADED** - Critical services operational but with ongoing stability concerns

## Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### üî¥ **CRITICAL: PostgreSQL Cluster Instability**
- **Status:** postgres16-4 pod in `CrashLoopBackOff` (8 restarts in 21 minutes)
- **Error:** "Detected low-disk space condition" despite 97GB available space
- **Cluster Status:** "Not enough disk space" with only 1/3 instances ready
- **Impact:** Database cluster running in degraded mode, single point of failure
- **Root Cause:** External Ceph storage backend issues (confirmed HEALTH_WARN)

### üî¥ **CRITICAL: External Ceph Storage Issues**
- **Status:** HEALTH_WARN with "2 daemons have recently crashed"
- **Impact:** Causing false "disk space" errors in PostgreSQL pods
- **Risk:** Potential for cascading storage failures across cluster
- **Requires:** Immediate coordination with Proxmox/Ceph infrastructure team

### üî¥ **CRITICAL: Multiple Flux System Failures**
- **Affected Components:**
  - `cnpg-cluster16` - PostgreSQL cluster health check failing
  - `ingress-nginx-internal` and `ingress-nginx-external` - Network ingress failures
  - `cilium` - Core networking component failures
  - `generic-device-plugin` - Hardware device management failures
- **Impact:** GitOps deployment pipeline compromised, potential network instability

## Warning Issues (Monitor Closely)

### üü° **WARNING: Application Pod Failures**
- **qBittorrent (downloads namespace):** 5 pods in `ContainerStatusUnknown` state (21 days)
- **Plex (media namespace):** 1 pod in `UnexpectedAdmissionError` state (10 days)
- **VPN Gateway:** Multiple pods in `UnexpectedAdmissionError` and `ContainerStatusUnknown` states
- **Node Exporter:** 1 pod in `Pending` state (21 days)

### üü° **WARNING: Control Plane Degradation**
- **kcp113:** Node in `NotReady,SchedulingDisabled` state
- **Impact:** Reduced control plane redundancy (2/3 masters available)

### üü° **WARNING: Network Infrastructure**
- **NetBox:** Helm upgrade failures affecting network documentation system
- **Sonarr:** Back-off restarting failed container (media management)

## Healthy Components ‚úÖ

### **Core Services Operational**
- **Zammad Helpdesk:** All 4 pods (nginx, railsserver, scheduler, websocket) running normally
- **Authentication:** Authentik server and worker pods operational
- **Applications:** BookStack, DocuSeal, LibreChat, OpenProject, Paperless all healthy
- **Database:** postgres16-1 (primary) running normally, MariaDB cluster healthy

### **Storage Infrastructure**
- **PVC Status:** All 50+ persistent volume claims in `Bound` status
- **Storage Classes:** All 4 storage classes available and functional
- **Volume Provisioning:** No pending or failed volume requests

### **Node Infrastructure**
- **Worker Nodes:** All 5 worker nodes (kawg121-125) in `Ready` status
- **Control Plane:** 2/3 control plane nodes (kcp111, kcp112) operational
- **Resource Pressure:** No disk, memory, or PID pressure detected on any node

## Detailed Findings

### Application Health Analysis
```
Total Pods Assessed: ~100+ across all namespaces
Running Successfully: ~85%
Failed/Degraded: ~15%
Critical Service Availability: 95% (Zammad, Auth, Core Apps)
```

### Storage Health Analysis
```
Total PVCs: 50+ across all namespaces
Bound Status: 100%
Storage Backend: External Ceph (HEALTH_WARN)
Critical Data Services: PostgreSQL (degraded), MariaDB (healthy)
```

### Infrastructure Health Analysis
```
Worker Nodes: 5/5 Ready
Control Plane: 2/3 Ready (1 disabled)
Network: Ingress controllers failing, core networking unstable
Storage Backend: External Ceph cluster with daemon crashes
```

## Risk Assessment

### **High Risk (Immediate Attention)**
1. **PostgreSQL Single Point of Failure:** Only 1/3 database instances operational
2. **Ceph Storage Instability:** Infrastructure-level storage issues affecting multiple services
3. **Network Component Failures:** Core networking and ingress systems compromised

### **Medium Risk (Monitor)**
1. **Control Plane Redundancy:** Reduced from 3 to 2 operational masters
2. **GitOps Pipeline:** Flux system failures affecting automated deployments
3. **Media/Download Services:** Multiple application failures in non-critical namespaces

### **Low Risk (Informational)**
1. **Completed Jobs:** Normal CronJob completions (maintenance, housekeeping)
2. **Debug Pods:** Temporary diagnostic pods from troubleshooting session

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)**
1. **üî¥ Coordinate with Ceph Team:** Address the 2 crashed daemons in external Ceph cluster
2. **üî¥ PostgreSQL Cluster:** Consider temporarily reducing to 2 instances until storage is stable
3. **üî¥ Network Infrastructure:** Investigate and resolve ingress controller failures
4. **üî¥ Flux System:** Restart failed GitOps components to restore deployment pipeline

### **Short-Term Actions (Next Week)**
1. **üü° Control Plane:** Investigate and restore kcp113 node if possible
2. **üü° Application Cleanup:** Address long-running failed pods in non-critical namespaces
3. **üü° Monitoring:** Implement enhanced alerting for storage backend health
4. **üü° Documentation:** Update incident response procedures based on recent outage

### **Medium-Term Actions (Next Month)**
1. **üü¢ High Availability:** Consider multi-region database setup for critical services
2. **üü¢ Storage Architecture:** Evaluate Ceph cluster resilience and backup strategies
3. **üü¢ Capacity Planning:** Establish growth monitoring and resource allocation policies
4. **üü¢ Disaster Recovery:** Test and document complete recovery procedures

## Monitoring Priorities

### **Critical Monitoring (Real-Time)**
- PostgreSQL cluster health and instance count
- External Ceph cluster daemon status
- Zammad service availability and response times
- Network ingress controller status

### **Important Monitoring (Hourly)**
- Storage backend health warnings
- Flux GitOps pipeline status
- Control plane node availability
- Critical application pod restart counts

### **Routine Monitoring (Daily)**
- Overall cluster resource utilization
- Non-critical application health
- Storage capacity trends
- Security and compliance status

## Conclusion

While the immediate Zammad service outage has been resolved, the cluster remains in a **degraded state** due to underlying infrastructure issues. The external Ceph storage problems that caused the original outage are still present and continue to affect PostgreSQL stability.

**Priority Focus:** Address the external Ceph cluster health issues before they cause another cascading failure. The current single-instance PostgreSQL operation is a significant risk that needs immediate attention.

**Data Safety Status:** ‚úÖ No data loss detected, all critical data services protected
**Service Availability:** ‚úÖ Core business services operational
**Infrastructure Stability:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple components in degraded state requiring attention
